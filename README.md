# InternationalNames
A project done in Matlab where I was tasked to create a name generator for children following naming conventions of various countries of the world.

The naming of people is a fascinating subject that varies so much around the world
and tells us so much about a country or society. Everywhere names mean
something, but often the meaning has been lost or obscured by time. The study of
personal names is known as onomastics. Behind this word lies an utterly absorbing
subject that tells us so much about history, geography, tradition and culture.
